# holiday-brushes
A collection of holiday-themed calligraphy brushes, programmed in Processing.

You will need Processing 3 to run this code. Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. It can be downloaded [here](https://processing.org/download). 

Most of the brushes began with snippets of code from “Getting Started with Processing” by Casey Reas & Ben Fry.
