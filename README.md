# Soso Seasonal Brushes

**A collection of seasonal calligraphy brushes, programmed in Processing.**

## Intro

We created these calligraphy brushes for our December 2015 holiday card. Since then, we've just started to expand our brush collection to include more fun styles. Most of the brushes began with snippets of code from “Getting Started with Processing” by Casey Reas & Ben Fry.

For a detailed behind the scenes, [check out](https://www.sosolimited.com/blog/programming-calligraphy-brushes/) our calligraphy brush blogpost.

## Setup

You will need Processing 3 to run this code. Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. It can be downloaded [here](https://processing.org/download). 

After installing processing, clone or download the repository to start playing! 

```
git clone https://github.com/sosolimited/Holiday-Brushes.git
```

## Controls

All of the apps have a handful of controls to adjust brush size, erase, and save images.

#### Mouse Controls

* Drag --> Draw with brush

#### Keypress Controls

* Up --> Increase brush size
* Down --> Decrease brush size
* Delete / Backspace --> Clear display
* 's' --> Save a png
* 'e' --> Hold and drag to erase

## Current Brushes

Here are a few examples of our current brushes. Each brush is self-contained in its own app folder.
